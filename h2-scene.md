Homework 2 for Haaga-Helia’s Cyber Security course (Karvinen 2025).

## a) Podcast

I chose to listen to the Darknet Diaries episode _159 Vastaamo_ (Rhysider & Tidy 3 June 2025).

- In 2020, a hacker breached the Finnish psychotherapy company Vastaamo and stole data on about 33,000 patients, including detailed therapy notes.
- The attacker first tried to extort the company and later targeted individual victims, demanding Bitcoin payments to keep their data private.
- The hacker deliberately released the most sensitive records first to cause maximum psychological harm and pressure both the company and the victims.
- During the attack, the hacker accidentally uploaded a large archive file that exposed clues leading investigators to a Helsinki-based cloud server.
- Finnish police traced the evidence to Julius Kivimäki, a member of the hacker group Lizard Squad.
- After an international arrest warrant, Kivimäki was captured in France in 2023, extradited to Finland, and later convicted.
- In April 2024, he was sentenced to six years and three months in prison for aggravated data breaches, privacy violations, and extortion.
- Vastaamo’s management failed to handle the crisis effectively, leading to bankruptcy and the CEO’s suspended sentence for data protection violations.
- The incident revealed serious weaknesses in Vastaamo’s cybersecurity practices, including unprotected databases, default credentials, and lack of encryption.
- Poor incident response and communication planning made the situation far worse than it needed to be.
- The company’s collapse shows how a single security failure can destroy an entire organization when data governance and business continuity are weak.
- The case highlights the severe human impact of cybersecurity breaches, as thousands of victims suffered emotional and psychological harm.
- The event reshaped Finland’s approach to data protection and raised awareness of privacy as a national security issue.
- A key question remains how much of the damage could have been prevented if Vastaamo had implemented end-to-end encryption, strict access controls, and a well-practiced response plan.

## b) Blog

I chose to read the latest post from Traficom’s (2025) _Information Security Now_ blog.

- The NCSC-FI reported that Microsoft 365 accounts are still being compromised at record levels, despite earlier warnings issued in September due to a surge in breaches.
- In September 2025, 117 compromise cases were reported, followed by 120 in October, showing that the problem continues to escalate.
- The alert applies to all organizations using M365, including both employees and administrators, as stolen credentials are being used for phishing and invoice fraud.
- Attackers often use compromised legitimate accounts to send phishing messages that appear authentic and include links to fake SharePoint or OneDrive files.
- Users are advised to verify messages from familiar senders through another channel (such as a call or instant message) before trusting them.
- The NCSC-FI recommends that M365 administrators enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA), use conditional access policies, and block logins from high-risk countries or IP ranges.
- Another section warns about invoice fraud, where criminals impersonate real companies or register fake billers.
- Fraudulent invoices have even reached online banking services, exploiting the trust placed in automated billing systems.
- The NCSC-FI advises organizations to verify invoices before payment, follow internal approval processes strictly, and report suspected fraud immediately to the police and the bank.
- The review also mentions a new EU cybersecurity funding call under the Digital Europe Programme, offering €50 million for projects related to AI-based tools, SME cybersecurity, and submarine cable protection.
- The Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) consultation is open for public feedback, particularly on conditions for delaying vulnerability reporting to authorities.
- The weekly malware section covers Nymaim, a Trojan downloader that installs ransomware and spreads through phishing emails and fake software updates.
- Protection tips include keeping systems updated, avoiding suspicious links or attachments, and maintaining up-to-date antivirus software.
- The report concludes with examples of recent phishing scams, including fake messages sent in the name of Suomi.fi and KEVA, both attempting to collect personal data.

## c) Science that

I chose to connect the _Darknet Diaries: Vastaamo_ episode and the _Traficom Information Security Now_ blog post to the article _A Systematic Literature Review on Risk Assessment in Cloud Computing: Recent Research Advancements_ (Drissi, Chergui & Khatar 2025).

- The article emphasizes that risk assessment (RA) is the foundation of cloud and information security, defining systematic processes for identifying, analyzing, and mitigating vulnerabilities that can lead to data breaches or system compromise.
- The study highlights that traditional static RA models often fail in dynamic environments such as modern cloud systems because they lack automation and real-time monitoring capabilities.
- This theoretical perspective directly relates to the Vastaamo case, where the psychotherapy company’s failure to assess and mitigate risks, like unencrypted databases and missing access controls, led to one of Finland’s most devastating privacy breaches.
- If Vastaamo had implemented a structured RA framework following standards mentioned in the article, the organization could have identified weak authentication, lack of encryption, and incident response gaps before the attack occurred.
- The paper also stresses the importance of automation and AI-driven RA models, capable of real-time anomaly detection through machine learning. This aligns with the Traficom blog, which reports that Microsoft 365 account compromises remain high because many organizations still rely on manual security management rather than automated detection and adaptive controls.
- The literature review further argues that compliance-driven RA must be continuous, not just a checklist, to ensure accountability in sensitive data environments. Both the Vastaamo incident and the M365 compromises demonstrate how insufficient compliance monitoring can lead to large-scale breaches or fraud.
- Finally, the paper concludes that future RA approaches should be adaptive, scalable, and AI-assisted, combining human expertise with continuous machine learning to detect emerging threats across cloud environments. This vision mirrors the direction recommended by Traficom for Finnish organizations adopting advanced monitoring and AI-based anomaly detection.

## d) Download Debian

I downloaded Debian according to the given instructions.
