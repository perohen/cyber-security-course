## a) SecuDream(tm)

* Goals
  * Understand the threat landscape: Students will gain an up-to-date understanding of modern cyber threats and attacker techniques, enabling them to recognize risks relevant to full-stack web applications and cloud services.
  * Navigate cybersecurity frameworks: Students will become familiar with cybersecurity models and frameworks (such as ISO/IEC 27001, Traficom Cybermeter) and understand compliance requirements in the Finnish context (e.g. GDPR), bridging management and technical perspectives.
  * Develop incident response and risk management skills: Students will be able to assess security risks at a high level and participate in incident response planning. They will learn to tie technical findings to business impacts.
* Agenda

    * Visitor: A specialist from the Finnish National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-FI) to provide the strategic national view.
  2. Cyber lab
    * Setting up the lab environment.
    * Port scanning: using Nmap to map network perimeters.
    * Password cracking: using Hashcat or John the Ripper to understand password entropy and hashing.
    * Encryption: sending secure messages with PGP to understand public key infrastructure.
    * Visitor: An officer from the Finnish Police’s cybercrime division to discuss investigation processes and the reality of cybercrime evidence.
  3. Cloud security
    * Focus on securing cloud environments using Azure.
    * Topics include identity and access management, secure configuration, logging and other best practices.
    * Visitor: A cloud security architect from Microsoft to demonstrate enterprise-scale defense.
  4. Pentesting web applications – Part I
    * Introduction to penetration testing methodologies and tools.
    * Students explore common vulnerabilities in a lab environment.
    * Finding hidden directories and endpoints using Ffuf.
    * Exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities.
  5. Pentesting web applications – Part II
    * Continuation of the previous session with more advanced topics.
    * CSRF, cookie security and malicious NPM packages in Node.js ecosystems.
    * Visitor: A specialist from a leading Finnish cybersecurity company (e.g., WithSecure or Nixu).
  6. Business continuity
    * Covers incident response planning, business continuity strategies and communication during a crisis.
    * Excursion: A visit to a security operations center (SOC) to witness real-time monitoring and incident response.
  7. Security maturity and risk management
    * Fundamentals of frameworks like Traficom’s Cybermeter, ISO/IEC 27001, NIS2 and GDPR.
    * Visitor: A legal expert to clarify the obligations and potential penalties under Finnish and EU law.
  8. Escape room event
    * Final session is an engaging hands-on escape room event.
    * Students solve challenges based on course topics.
* Exercises
  * Cybermeter
  * Cracking passwords with Hashcat and John the Ripper
