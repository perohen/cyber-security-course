Homework 1 (Karvinen 2025) for Haaga-Helia’s Cyber Security course.

## a) Science hunt

I used HH Finna’s article search to find a suitable review article related to the course topics. I entered the search query: ”threat modeling literature review”. From the results, I selected article by Drissi, Chergui and Khatar (2025).

I chose this article because it matches the course’s cybersecurity themes, focusing on cloud computing, risk assessment, and AI-based security frameworks. The paper is a review article published in IEEE Access, a journal with JUFO level 1. This article is peer-reviewed and recent as it is published in 2025.

## b) Review the review

### Key areas being researched
- Cloud Risk Assessment (RA)
    - Analysis and adaptation of existing RA frameworks for cloud environments, evaluating their strengths, weaknesses and applicability.
- AI integration
    - Use of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) to enable real-time threat detection, anomaly identification and automated mitigation.
- Cloud-specific challenges
    - Addressing issues such as multi-tenancy, shared resources and dynamic resource allocation.
- Methodological evaluation
    - Comparing qualitative, quantitative and hybrid RA approaches to improve decision-making.
- Regulatory and compliance frameworks
    - Integration of RA practices with global standards e.g. GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA, ISO 27001, NIST and CSA STAR.
- Service and deployment models
    - RA methods for different cloud service (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, CaaS) and deployment models (public, private, hybrid, community).
- Automation and scalability
    - Development of adaptive and real-time RA methods to address dynamic multi-tenant cloud environments.
- Collaborative security models
    - Shared responsibility between cloud providers, users, administrators and developers to enhance security awareness and accountability.
- RA lifecycle coverage
    - Covering all stages of RA across both pre- and post-adoptation phases.

### What’s widely agreed upon
- Cloud advantages and complexity
    - While cloud computing offers flexibility, scalability and cost efficiency, its dynamic and multi-tenant nature introduces new vulnerabilities compared to traditional systems.
- Essential role of RA
    - Effective RA is needed for identifying, analyzing and mitigating risks.
- Limitations of traditional models
    - Static, legacy RA frameworks are inadequate for today’s cloud systems.
- Need for automation and AI
    - Dynamic and automated RA solutions are required to enhance real-time detection, mitigation and response. AI, ML and DL are crucial for predictive, adaptive and automated cloud risk management.
- Regulatory alignment
    - Compliance with e.g. GDPR, HIPAA and CCPA is a fundamental component of modern RA frameworks.

### Open questions
- Lack of standardization
    - No universally accepted or comprehensive RA framework exists for modern cloud ecosystems.
- Limited real-world validation
    - Many proposed models are tested in simulations, not in real operational environments.
- Missing datasets
    - There are no public, high-quality datasets tailored to cloud-specific risk analysis.
- Scalability and adaptability issues
    - AI-based frameworks face challenges with computational cost and scalability across diverse cloud types.
- Emerging threats
    - Multi-cloud and multi-tenancy vulnerabilities, AI model poisoning, and zero-day risks remain underexplored.
- Decline in research activity
    - Academic attention to cloud RA has decreased since 2020.
